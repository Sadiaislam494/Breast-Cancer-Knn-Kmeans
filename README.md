Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction using KNN and K-Means
This project is about predicting whether a breast cancer case is malignant or benign using machine learning. I used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for supervised classification and K-Means Clustering for unsupervised grouping. The goal was to see how well these algorithms can identify cancer types from the dataset.
